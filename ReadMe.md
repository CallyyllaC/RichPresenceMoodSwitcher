<h1>Discord Rich Preesence Mood Switcher</h1>
<br>
<h3>This is just a small program that I made to make discord more customisable and allows you to express yourself more</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2>How To</h2>
<br>
<h3>For this part you need to be in your browser</h3>
<ul>
<li>Goto <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/">this link</a> and create an app you want your profile to say is currently playing</li>
<li>Enable rich presence on your new discord app</li>
<li>Upload your images, small and large</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>For the next part goto your Settings.txt file</h3>
<ul>
<li>At the top it gives you an example of how they are set out</li>
<li><ul><li>Button name, this can only be changed for the custom buttons to help you recognise what they do</li><li>ID this is the client ID of the discord application you just made!</li><li>The state and details are the text that describe what you are playing, but they can be whatever you want</li><li>The large image name is the name of any large image you uploaded to the application you just made</li><li>The large image text is the text which will display when hovering over the large image</li><li>The small image name is the name of any small image you uploaded to the application you just made</li><li>The small image text is the text which will display when hovering over the small image</li></ul></li>
<li>Fill out all the buttons you want then you are ready!</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>When launched the file does not automatically select a mood, you will have to do this manually</p>
<p>Each time you press a new button it does not keep existing entries, so ensure that everything you want is filled in</p>
<p>The settings file is line number based so adding or removing lines will knock it out of sync</p>
<p>The program reads the settings file on launch, so you need to restart the program before updates take place</p>
<p>It may take a few moments before discord updates so be patient</p>
